The default music player is Groove and this is the one that starts when I press music player button. I cannot change the default program to Spotify, because it does not show up in the list when I go to default programs > music player. I just cancelled Spotify as my phone carrier has given me 6 months apple music for free. But every time I want to hear music Spotify launches and goes into those annoying ad frenzies.

Whenever my phone attaches to my car’s b’tooth it will auto play Apple Music if I don’t already have a music app open. I’m wondering if I can change my default music player from Apple Music to Spotify. I have had a Spotify account since before I had an iPhone and want to have the phone default to Spotify instead of Apple Music. Is this even possible. I started using a 3rd party music player, and when I search from the universal Google search in CPL for one of my downloaded songs , it only shows an option for the built in LG music app(I dont like it) and Google Play Music, but Phonograph doesn't show in there. Is there a way to make the search show the Phonograph app and maybe hide the other. Any body also experience. I was using a different music player that I didn't really care for so I tried a few others and settled on Poweramp. I cleared my previous default app's status as the default and then opened an mp3 file so I could set Poweramp as the new default. Strangely, Poweramp did not show up in the list of compatible apps. I then uninstalled the old music player and tried opening an mp3 again, but now it just opens up in Google Play Music because it thinks that's the only music player I have installed. I am trying to set Spotify as my default music player so my media keys on my board work with the spotify, rather than trying to skip and opening up Groove Music. I tried to change the file associations of mp3, but was not able to choose Spotify. Does anyone know how to fix this/is this unfixable. Is there an easier way to do this than setup an alternate account on my tablet so I can login through the Home app and set their Spotify account as their music player. 
Is this even possible? Apple Music has never shown up as an option in my music player default settings. Mate 10 pro. At least 3x a day I'll pull my phone out of my pocket and a violinist song is playing on the default music app. The screen is locked when I put the phone in my pocket. This happening to anyone Its really frustrating when you are riding in your bike and you press the play/pause and if you are not subscribed to apple music, then we hear nothing. This one has come up before, and I've tried several tweaks (DefaultPlayer, Spotiplay) however have not found one that works 24/7. Anyone had any success here on ios 11.3.1? Thanks. Is there a tweak that does the above for ios 11? DefaultPlayer tweak has not been updated. </p>
